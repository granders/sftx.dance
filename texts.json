  "about_us": "San Francisco Tango Exchange (SFTX) was an annual tango event that ran from 2006 - 2009. SFTX concentrates on using guided exercises and technical games as a platform to a weekend of tango adventures. We aim to create an inclusive environment for every dancer to 'explore, discover, and exchange'. We're working to reboot it.",

  "what_to_expect":[
    "Come with an open mind. You’ll expand your comfort zone, both in terms of tango skills and socially. Moments when you say “I don’t know this, can I get starter help?” are great and are much encouraged.",
    "Help others figure things out. This is an exchange, so kindly offer to explain or demonstrate if you can, especially when asked.",
    "Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing is encouraged. Ask “are you open to feedback?” “Yes,” “no,” and “some” are all valid replies.",
    "Role preferences are not based on gender. If someone asks you to dance and does not ask your preference, let them know your preferred role before you start dancing.",
    "Respect the pronouns of your community members. If someone does not ask for your pronoun and it differs from the pronoun they are using, please let them know.",
    "Use feedback: participate. This is also your event, constructive feedback is appreciated."
